## 🔍 Problem
Many individuals are uncertain about when to seek care, leading to either delayed medical attention or overuse of emergency services. This is especially true for underserved populations without immediate access to health professionals.


## 💡 Solution
CareSense provides an intelligent triage system that:
- Classifies the urgency of symptoms (Low, Medium, High)
- Recommends appropriate care actions and specialties
- Logs user symptom history for pattern recognition and better support
- Uses real symptom descriptions extracted from medical report images via OCR 

## ⚙️ Features
- Natural language symptom input
- Urgency level + care guidance
- Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 train_model.py
streamlit run app.py
```
