- Recommends appropriate care actions and specialties
- Logs user symptom history for pattern recognition and better support
- Uses real symptom descriptions extracted from medical report images via OCR 

## ⚙️ Features
- Natural language symptom classification
- Enriched outputs: care type, suggested specialty, and urgency level
- Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit
- OCR image

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
